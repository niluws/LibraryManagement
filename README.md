# Library Management System

This is an online library management system built using Django Rest Framework (DRF). It allows users to borrow and return books, view available books, and generate income reports. The system also includes features for managing customers, categories, and books.

## Features

- **Book Borrowing:** Users can borrow books, and the system tracks the number of books borrowed, return dates, and available stock.

- **Book Returning:** Users can return borrowed books, and the stock is updated accordingly.

- **Book Listing:** Managers can view the list of available books and filter them based on title, genre, type, and stock.

- **Book Posting:** Managers can add new books to the library.

- **Income Reporting:** Managers can generate income reports for different book categories, including income from book borrowings and book purchases.
